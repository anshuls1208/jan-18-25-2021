* Create a package com.intuit.lab01 and implement this lab
* Create an actor that prints current temperature of a city
* The actor prints temperature(a random number) for Chennai, Bengaluru, Pune, Mumbai, Kochi, Delhi, Bhopal
* For any other city it displays "Not available"
* If you pass a message "history" it displays all the city names and their temperatures computed earlier
* Have a simple console interface where you read the input of the city from the user and pass it to the actor.
* If the input is "q", the application ends.
